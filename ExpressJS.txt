WHAT IS EXPRESS ?
-----------------
Express is a fast, unopinionated and minimalist web framework for Node.js

Express is a "server side" or "back-end" framework. It is not comparable to client-side frameworks like React, Angulat & Vue. It can be used in combination with those frameworks to build full stack applications.

WHY USE EXPRESS ?
-----------------
- Makes building web applications with Node.js MUCH easier.
- Used for both server rendered apps as well as API.Microservices
- Extremeley light, fast and free
- Full control of request and response
- By far the most popular Node framework
- Great to use with client side frameworks as it's all JavaScript


BASIC SERVER SYNTAX
-------------------

const express = require('express');

// Init express 
const app = express();

// Create your endpoints/route handlers
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Listen on a port
app.listen(5000);

BASIC ROUTE HANDLING
--------------------
- Handling requests/routes is simple
- app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc
- Access to params, query strings, url parts, etc.
- Express has a router so we can store routes in seperate files and export
- We can parse incomin data with the Body Parser
